This is the Nintendo DS port of NickDeGamer1's Original Campaign, I worked on this during the break between my Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters.

Created using NightFox (https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and Libnds (https://libnds.devkitpro.org/) libraries.

Compilation instructions:

Simply download and extract the zip file of this repository, and run 'make' within the root of the extracted directory. Then copy the outputted .nds file to either no$gba to emulate, or to a real console.
