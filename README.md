# Original Campaign for the Nintendo DS

This is a Nintendo DS port of Original Campaign (a game concept made by a friend of mine), I worked on this during the break between my Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters.

Created using the [NightFox](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and [Libnds](https://libnds.devkitpro.org/) libraries.

# Compilation instructions:

* Windows Instructions: 

Be sure that [devkitPro](https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases) is installed on your system (needed for libNDS), and that it is included as a system environment variable named DEVKITPRO which paoints to the installation. Then download and extract the zip file of this repository, and run 'make' within the root of the extracted directory. Then copy the outputted .nds file to either the [no$gba](https://www.nogba.com/) Nintendo DS emulator to emulate, or to a real console.
