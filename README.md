# Original Campaign for the Nintendo DS

This is a Nintendo DS port of Original Campaign (a game concept made by a friend of mine), I worked on this during the break between my Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 semesters.

Created using the [NightFox](https://github.com/knightfox75/nds_nflib) and [Libnds](https://libnds.devkitpro.org/) libraries.

# Instructions:

Download the latest release of this game from [the releases page](https://github.com/bm17tala/oc-for-the-ds/releases), then run the downloaded .nds file within either the [no$gba](https://www.nogba.com/) Nintendo DS emulator to emulate (requires Windows), or to a real console.
